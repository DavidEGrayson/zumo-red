the robot has turned since the last time turnSensorReset was
called.  This is computed solely using the Z axis of the gyro, so
it could be inaccurate if the robot is rotated about the X or Y
axes.

Our convention is that a value of 0x20000000 represents a 45
degree counter-clockwise rotation.  This means that a uint32_t
can represent any angle between 0 degrees and 360 degrees.  If
you cast it to a signed 32-bit integer by writing
(int32_t)turnAngle, that integer can represent any angle between
-180 degrees and 180 degrees. */
